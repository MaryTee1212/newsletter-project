      We had an amazing turnout with around 40 students coming together to learn
      coding. The enthusiasm and engagement were truly inspiring, creating a
      vibrant and collaborative learning environment.

      We are honored to have Mrs. Omofoye Mary, a software developer at Zealarax
      Technologies, as our Tutor. Her presence is especially inspiring,
      showcasing the achievements of women in a male-dominated sector like tech.
      Her expertise and passion have motivated not only the men in our class but
      also the women, who now see new possibilities in Coding.

      <b>Student-Led Projects:</b> As part of our class projects, we
      brainstormed and came up with the innovative idea of receiving newsletters
      as students, aside from accessing information through the school website.
      This project aims to enhance communication and keep everyone updated with
      the latest developments, events, and opportunities within our coding
      class.
